# 2024-Eclipse-Data

This repository contains data that I collected during the solar eclipse that took place on April 8, 2024.

The data was collected using a weather station consisting of a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/) with a [Weather Hat](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/weather-hat?variant=39672186765395).

The weather station was located at [Wind Point Park](https://www.windpointparktx.com/) in Texas (CST), but the timestamps have been converted to EST.
